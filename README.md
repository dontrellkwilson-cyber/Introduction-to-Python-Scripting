**` Tasks Completed `**
- Configured static IP on Windows Server (Domain Controller). 
- Assigned IP address **172.16.0.1**, subnet mask **255.255.255.0**, and DNS **127.0.0.1**.  
- Set DNS to point to the Domain Controller.
- No default gateway was configured because the lab uses an isolated internal network. All communication occurs within the local environment between the Domain Controller and the client system.  

**` Overview `** 
-  This step establishes network communication by assigning a static IP address to the Domain Controller. Proper IP configuration ensures reliable connectivity and supports Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP services.

</p>

  **` Tasks Completed `**
- Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role.  
- Promoted Windows Server to Domain Controller.  
- Created a new domain (mydomain.com).  
- Configured DNS during domain setup.  
- Verified successful domain deployment.  

**` Overview `** 
-  This step establishes centralized identity and access management by configuring the server as a Domain Controller. Active Directory allows administrators to manage users, systems, and resources within a domain, which is a core function in enterprise IT environments.

</p>

**` Tasks Completed `**
- Installed the Remote Access role on Windows Server.  
- Enabled Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS).  
- Configured NAT to allow internal network access to the Internet.  
- Selected the external network interface for Internet access.  
- Verified client connectivity to external networks.  

**` Overview `** 
-  This step allows devices on the internal network to access external networks through Network Address Translation. NAT enables multiple systems to share a single external connection, which is commonly used in enterprise environments to manage and secure outbound traffic.

 **` Tasks Completed `**
- Opened Server Manager and accessed Local Server settings.  
- Disabled Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration (IE ESC).  
- Verified internet access from the Domain Controller using a web browser.  

**` Overview `** 
-  This step enables internet access from the Domain Controller for testing. In a production environment, Domain Controllers are typically restricted from direct internet browsing to reduce security risks, but this is enabled in the lab to validate connectivity and functionality.
